I am 41 yo now.  It has always felt very unfair.  But at this stage in my life, as the caregiver to my mother (stroke 65yo), and my grandmother (91yo dementia), I have realized that as we age, it comes to all of us.  At 91, my grandmother has lived a life free of any health problems, has never had chronic pain, and wouldn't know what a headache was like if she were hit in the head with a hammer.But, my grandfather died about 20 years ago, and she has never stopped grieving.  She has been in immense psychological pain for more 20 years.  She was also abused as a child, so has trauma from a life of abuse before that.  She has had pain daily for her whole life.My mother has had chronic pain her entire life from childhood.  Whether the form of pain is physical, emotional or psychological, none of us are safe from it.  Some people get to live longer without pain.  They get a longer period of their lives free of trauma, physical pain, or emotional pain- but eventually- the pain comes for them too. People like us, we had a shorter ride to chronic pain.  We didn't get as many years of freedom as we would have liked.But understand that you are not alone.  Every human on this big blue ball has pain.  Just like many of us have invisible illnesses, most every person in the world suffers from invisible pain.  You are not special, you are not unique, you are not alone.  Just because your friend group or family might not have a chronic illness, it does not mean they do not have pain.  It means they classify their pain differently.There is one advantage to living a life like ours- riding the early short bus to chronic pain.  Pain and survival build resilience.  We learn very early in our journey how to cope with grief, sadness, anger, and how to adapt quickly.  Those who ride the late bus to chronic pain have to develop these tools late in life, when it is more difficult to develop new coping skills.  They often never learn coping skills, and never move on with their lives.We learn how to adapt and change, because we have done it so many times before.  We become stronger everytime a doctor doesn't believe us.  We grow stronger everytime we drag ourselves out of bed for one more day of work when we can barely make it.  We grow stronger every day we survive what is sometimes a nightmare of life.  This strength of understanding how to navigate pain puts us years ahead of the people in our lives who haven't ridden the bus to chronic pain yet.  When the day comes that your friend who was always healthy and pain free finally takes that ride to chronic pain, they will look at you and wonder how you ever survived.  They will fall off the cliff into depression and grief.  Hopefully, you will be there to help pull them out and share the tools that you have learned.", "label": 1}, {"text": "Yeah, but they play life on easy mode.", "label": 0}, {"text": "How long is too long for low back pain", "label": 0}, {"text": "I'm going on 20 years so.....", "label": 0}, {"text": "Since 1986 for me.", "label": 0}, {"text": "If it lasts longer than 6 weeks, you should see a doctor.

It boggles my mind how much misogyny and fat phobia exists in the medical profession! Fuck each and everyone of those ableists.But hey, I have some advice if you\u2019d like it.I\u2019ve been struggling after putting on 45 pounds during a multi month course of prednisone last year. I\u2019m 5\u20192\u201d and was topping 225. I have been careful with my food intake for years and had been loosing weight (healthily) prior to the prednisone. Because midlife diabetes runs in my family, a little bird told me to start monitoring my glucose about two years. After some very high test results, I brought the data to my pcp to show her that my glucose was not looking good and she did an A1C test right there. It was borderline diabetes. The culprit is that prednisone weight gain coupled with the fact that prednisone is known to induce diabetes. She immediately put me on metformin, which can be used to bath control glucose levels and induce weight loss. I\u2019ve lost 15 lbs in a month of treatment AND my glucose is settling down while I rework my diet. Anyway, that\u2019s a long story to say that you might try this approach (of home glucose testing) to get your doctor to actually help with your weight loss instead of just judging you by it (like an asshole). I swear to god, when doctors know you are actively tackling your weight issue, they suddenly can diagnose and treat the other ailments they attributed to weight. I also second and third taking pictures of every physically apparent symptom you experience. Every dang time I went to my doctor, the swelling would resolve just in time for her to say she saw no evidence of my proclaimed symptoms.

I get a weird warm sensation in different parts of my body. It'll usually last a couple weeks and go away, then come back in a different spot a few months later. The first time it was my fingertips, I remember touching a plastic bag at work and wondering how the plastic bag felt hot, then I realized it was my fingers. The next spot was the front of my thighs, it would feel like I was leaning against a hot oven even though nothing was there. It also has a sort of..idk, creeping sensation? It reminds me of sitting in warm water with clothes on (oddly specific memory from when I was a kid). I've had it on my feet, around my knees, for awhile it was my butt and everything felt like a heated seat. Sometimes I get this horrible pain in my throat. It isn't like a sore throat but more like something has *structurally* gone wrong with my throat, and I can't swallow without horrendous pain. It can last for a minute or two or up to 45 minutes. It's like something in my throat is broken and I can't do anything to release it. The worst time I considered calling 911 because the pain was so severe that I couldn't even touch my neck without getting electric shocks of pain through my face and side of my head. I laid on the floor and cried and couldn't even move without the pain flaring up. I have my suspicions of what it is after a lot of google searches, but when I went to the walk in to ask about it the doctor told me it was a muscle spasm and it's nothing. Okay dude, you try not being able to swallow your saliva for nearly an hour without feeling like you're being tased in the face and see if you still think it's nothing. Sometimes I get this really sudden and intense sort of muscle spasm that makes me whip my head to the right. Once I fell out of my seat on the bus because it was so intense. It happens maybe every other year. It hurts but lasts maybe one second.In 2017 I had a bad flu, I think the worst I've ever had. Second day I woke up with huge black blotches in my vision. I won't go into all the details but I now have apparently permanent spots in my vision, they're sort of like transparent static that swirls and I can forget they're there. Neurologist laughed at me. Ophthalmologist saw \"migraines\" on my history and immediately said it's migraine aura...except that shouldn't last 24/7 for 6 years, but they wouldn't elaborate beyond \"scintillating scotoma\". My doctor suspected it's immune related but with both the ophthalmologist and neurologist saying it's nothing she wasn't sure what to do about it. I definitely have small fiber neuropathy, but didn't realize how much it impacted me until last year. I'm in university and in one lab the instructor said to combine chemicals slowly and to touch the tube to make sure it hasn't gone beyond \"warm.\" He came around to check and touched the tube and went \"yikes, that's too hot.\" To me it must felt warm-mildly hot. Another lab we used bulbs, I took one out and it didn't bother me but my partner went to move it and nearly dropped it because it was too hot. My cat really likes to walk on me and sleep on me, and often just the weight of her feet on me are enough to make me yell, it feels like a 200 pound person is standing on me in high heels. Once I woke up and my vision seemed greyed out, like there was no colour. It only lasted about 15 minutes and gradually went back to normal. This was what triggered my doctor to send me for an MRI even if the neurologist said it wasn't necessary. Everything was normal though.", "label": 1}, {"text": "Weird ones - skin crawling. I couldn't explain it before until I saw someone mentioning it on this forum. It feels like an electric current is moving from one spot to another with tingling and something crawling under skin  sensation. Happens when I walk for prolonged time and sit to rest. Related to movement or excercise - my fingers get swollen sometimes if I'm very active, something like running or other sports which I haven't done in a while. Another one - random pains out of nowhere. I would be walking, just regular walking from room to kitchen, no sudden or unusual moves, and I get this raging pain in my knee like I twisted it or broke it! It can happen to random body parts. Before I would be panicking whether I should call a doctor or something, maybe my bones are crumbling, who knows, but decide to wait and see if it goes away in case it's just \"my weird body\". So yeah, these can last from a few hours to a few days, me limping or unable to move affected body part much but eventually it dissappears on its own. Someone else mentioned - forgetting breathing - that's a newly discovered one. Also the one that bugs me a lot (I mean all symptoms do but this is so annoying) - my voice changes. Idk if it's fibro, I think it is because I've checked everything from allergies to vocal cords and it's a usual annoying \"all tests are normal, you're healthy\" crap. So one minute I would have a nice clear voice and and another it becomes hoarse like I've been smoking for 90 years, or it sounds like I'm crying, or it's fading away and people can't hear me. Yes, when I'm in crash it usually definitely worse but that range of crazy can be on a good day. It's impossible to predict what will come out of my mouth any given second and its so frustrating when communicating with others! Adding fibro fog on top of it and I feel like a complete weirdo dumbass that can't even figure out what or how to say stuff. The rest is the usual, all kind sensitivities, noise, sound, touch, smells, and pain and stuff - you guys know how it goes :(. And impossible decisions to make all the time - like now im too cold so I'm wearing a sweater but it irritates me so much that I want to take it off with my skin! I can put the heater on but that will make my skin crawl from heat and dry air so I will need to put lotion with my freezing hands that will make me more cold. In any case lotion won't help much because it's air that irritates me deep in my core. I can add humidifier of course but then it will be too dumpy\ud83d\ude44.

Thanks to advancements in medical research and technology, we now have a better understanding of pain and its various causes, as well as a wider range of treatments and therapies available to help people cope with chronic pain.\r  \r  One major breakthrough in pain management is the development of new medications that are specifically designed to target and block pain signals in the body. These medications can range from over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen to more potent prescription drugs like opioids or nerve blockers. However, it's important to work closely with a doctor to find the right medication and dosage for your needs, as some of these drugs can have serious side effects or risks.\r  \r  Another key development in pain management is the growing popularity of non-invasive treatments like physical therapy, acupuncture, and chiropractic care. These therapies can help reduce pain and improve mobility without the need for surgery or medication. Additionally, the use of tools like foam rollers and massage balls can help relieve muscle tension and improve flexibility, while heating pads and ice packs can help reduce inflammation and swelling.\r  \r  Mindfulness practices like meditation and deep breathing have also become increasingly popular as a way to manage pain and reduce stress and anxiety. These practices can help people become more aware of their thoughts and emotions, which can in turn help them better manage pain and reduce the impact that chronic pain has on their mental and emotional well-being.\r  \r  Beyond medical treatments and therapies, there are also a wide range of lifestyle changes that can help people better manage pain and improve their quality of life.

No amount of upper middle class money can buy my health. And therefore no amount of money can make it so I can pretty much get out of bed.

There\u2019s a lot I can\u2019t do anymore, but I try to go after the things I can. Being disabled has shown me what\u2019s really important to me in my life and it has drowned out the distractions.

Since my last adjustment in early December I\u2019ve been bedridden, getting worse daily, had the worst migraine of my life everyday.I can physically feel my C2 or C3 sticking out of my neck as far as my thumb is wide, it\u2019s excruciating and all the comfort I get is \u201cyou should just learn to manage your pain better\u201d. Having my family tell me to get up and walk when they literally watched me collapse, ball my eyes out, and have my entire body spasm for 30 minutes because of how bad the pain was.I have a super high pain tolerance having dealt with my neck 4 years. Everyday shows me a level of pain I didn\u2019t know could exist, I\u2019m never not in pain, yet I go through the majority of my days with a smile on my face, the one time I express my pain and how I feel, I get treated like I\u2019m overreacting.Sorry to use ur post as a place to rant lol, ik how you feel, having your pain disable you to the point you can\u2019t do anything. I wake up every single day, at first grateful to see another day and be apart of this beautiful thing we call life, but the fact I wake up everyday in more pain the last, I can\u2019t help but feel it\u2019s getting to the point where waking up really just feels pointless.Much love friend, there\u2019s better days ahead, there has to be.We just gotta have the fight and ambition to make it there, love yourself for being as strong as you are and coming as far as you have, what\u2019s one more day?Always remember, that you are a warrior.Keep yuh head up fam\ud83d\udc93\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffd", "label": 1}, {"text": "Lay like a corpse until it passes", "label": 0}, {"text": "I listen to alot of music i use a pair of headphones that really block out any outside noise.

I am not affiliated with either of them. Last September (2022) scrolling through FB at 3am with yet another migraine (have had them for over 40 years) I saw an ad for the Texas Migraine Clinic.  I got in touch with them, had a free consult, and started to work with them. Dr Turner has a TOTALLY different take on migraines than any practitioner I've seen. I had been going to chiropractors for over 40 years, and at the time, I was seeing one every day. I can't say my migraines have disappeared completely....but they are much less frequent.  And I'm often able to get rid of one when I feel one coming on.  If you go to the Texas Migraine Clinic website you can get an idea of his work and request a free consult. This is not a treatment that goes on forever.  It's usually a 6 week program (or 6 sessions). He's a super nice man.  Everything is over Zoom.The other thing I did was join the Curable app.  Curable is an app for chronic pain. There's a lot of free info they give you that helps you decide if it would be beneficial to join. I think I paid $49 for the year...well worth it for me.  After a couple of months using the app, I decided to join one of their small 12 week live groups.  This has been much more helpful than I imagined.  Again, I am not connected with either of these.

How to find them is a matter in not well-versed in; I've been out of the dating pool for the last 8 years.In the meantime, explore your options for having caretaker assistance that isn't family. Even if it's just part-time, it can be a big relief for those closest to you to know that you will have some access to a qualified professional caretaker. There are also entire communities, self-enclosed neighborhoods designed for a balance of freedom, regular caretaker assistance, and accessible amenities.

It's much like what I went through, but there are distinctions that make our situations different. Divorces/breakups happen, and it really sucks when they do. I'm saddened to see that you and your former partner are not going to be a happy couple. The good side of that is that you can still be happy on your own, though it is admittedly more difficult to be happy after a divorce. I'm trying to NOT offer you advice. I hope you learn something from this or someone else because everyone deserves to be happy, especially you. At a certain point in your day, I hope you get to a point where you say to yourself, \"enough is enough in trying to fix this relationship even in attempts that involve going back in time with a time machine\" for your own good. You deserve some peace, away from constantly thinking about your ex, the breakup, or how your life is going to be. I, too, have had trouble getting my ex (and all the rest) out of my head so I can specifically think about things that are NOT in any way to do with my ex, their family, or anything that brings me back to either one of those. It's tough. It takes time and effort, and unfortunately, it's not a \"it takes time\" or a \"it takes effort.\" It takes both time and effort, and it's not convenient, short in time (to do), nor is it easy. I still hope that after you are beaten up by this \"where did I go wrong\" all day long that you eventually get to a point in time where you just go, \"fuck it. I am 100% fucking tired of having to deal with this mess. Fuck it all and fuck it now because I am 100% tired of thinking about the whole mess of things.\" And I hope you do that for your own sake. You shouldn't beat yourself up over anything (all humans make mistakes) but even if you do, I hope you have a cut-off valve that at least gives you a couple hours of watching mindless TV because that is much, much better than tearing yourself to pieces because of what someone else decided. You're a good person; you don't deserve to be forever tortured (especially when it's you who's torturing you). Recovering from something like a divorce is going to take time, so I hope you're giving yourself time to recover. It doesn't mean you're weak, realizing that recovering from things like divorce ALWAYS takes TIME. So, to endure, we have to be able to wait even though we're in pain. Kind of like going to a restaurant when you've pulled a groin muscle: it takes time to get what one wants; one DOES get to order what one wants BUT one must be able to endure waiting otherwise one should have just stayed home and had cereal to eat again all alone. The pulled groin fortunately kind of goes away on its own.I can't tell you that everything gets easier/ everything gets better with time because I have yet to experience everything. What I can tell you is that pain takes time to stop hurting. This pain you are feeling now is going to take time until it stops hurting. I hope you 1. are ready to wait and 2. I hope you realize that you are able to wait, because that's what it takes. Please tell me that you have a therapist of one variety or the other because they will be instrumental in making sure that you're healing correctly instead of just finding a bunch of bad coping mechanisms like drinking alcohol, vaping, smoking cigarettes, driving recklessly, and/or self harm (the list of bad coping mechanisms goes on & on...).

The only difference in my case was that my wife also moved out right away (literally the next morning after telling me she'd leave me) and moved in with another guy 3 weeks later. Turns out they had already been seeing each other for a while. But I don't think he was the main reason she left me. Her main reason was my disability, which has gotten significantly worse during the past 6-7 years. Just like in your case, my wife didn't talk to me about her struggles and when she finally dumped me, she refused to give our marriage another chance. I begged her to go to therapy with me. I made a million different suggestions. I told her she could move out but we could stay married, so she'd feel more free. It was very painful to make these suggestions but I made them anyway. But she just said no to everything.I, too, wanted to have kids really badly. And although I'm a bit younger than you (34), I'm not sure I'll ever get that chance. I don't even know I'll ever find a new partner. I definitely won't ever find a woman like her... she was the love of my life and perfect in absolutely every way.I, too, have indescribable regret and I, too, feel a lot of anger. Towards myself, towards her, towards others. I've been seeing a therapist for several years and after my wife left me, my therapist said: \"I saw this coming a long time ago, I should've told you to do something about it before it's too late\". Yet, she didn't. No one told me anything. And I wasn't able to feel it because I was too busy with my disability wrecking my body and soul.I, too, was very scared of the practicalities. But looking back from 1 year in the future, I can promise you that the practicalities will be figured out. I was very stressed about them in the beginning but I'm now doing pretty well in this department. I'm living a very independent life and I'm proud of that.What hasn't gone away is the pain and lovesickness. Still today, I think of my ex-wife every single day and I dream of her most nights. I miss her so, so, so much. When I masturbate, I think of having sex with her rather than other women. I know it's not a healthy behavior but I can't help it. It's humiliating, knowing that she's living and having sex with some other guy now but I can't help it. I'd do absolutely anything to get her back. Just like your wife has done, my wife told me some extremely painful things right after she left me. Still, I'd take her back in a heartbeat.For roughly 9 months I've now been hanging out on various dating apps, trying to find a new partner. But it's fucking hard man. I hate how literally every single woman on every dating app wants a guy who is \"optimistic\", \"positive\", \"cheerful\", \"fun\" etc.. I'm so sick of reading crap like: \"I love my life and you should, too!\" and \"Live, love, laugh!\" - obviously written by able-bodied women who don't have any major problems in their lifes. You're basically not allowed to have any baggage. If you do, you're immediately sieved out. But how CAN'T I have baggage when I've gone through some truly traumatizing experiences thanks to my disability? Just today a girl on a dating app texted me: \"It sounds like you take life lightly and don't worry about the things you went through, is that right? Cuz I like people like that.\" How does one even respond to a message like this? If I say: \"yes, that's right\", I tell her a giant lie (something I hate doing). However, if I'm honest and I say: \"Not exactly, of course my disability has taken a serious toll on me\", she'll ghost me right away.And then, my thoughts are naturally drawn to my ex-wife again. Despite 9 months of intensive dating app usage, I haven't been on a single date and I've had longer conversations with maybe 3 women. It's so indescribably depressing. And so, naturally, I think to myself: \"God, if I still had HER, I wouldn't need to talk to all these clowns on these dating apps.\" But I can't even talk to her in a regular fashion because she has completely broken off contact with me. After my wife left me, I asked her if we could at least remain friends but she said: \"No, you'll just use the friendship to ask me for help with something and I don't want to help you with anything anymore.\"So... unfortunately, I don't have much advice to give. As you can tell, my mental health is still miserable. I've been suffering immensely from this break-up. But at least I can empathize with you 1000000%. And just one recommendation: try to find something that gives you joy. I started participating in a theater ensemble. It's not quite easy with my disability but the people in the group are very nice about it. I've always wanted to perform a theater play and now I get to do that this year. They even gave me a lead role, which I'm very proud of. The new hobby hasn't made the pain go away but it has made it at least a little more bearable. I practice at home almost every day and at least during that hour that I practice, I forget about my wife and I focus completely on the material. So... if there's some kind of hobby you can do that would give you joy, maybe you should consider trying that out.Obviously, I'm incredibly sorry this happened to you.

Like drug testing, its suggested but not a requirement. Thats in the US.

They cant drag you in front of a judge for violations. Its really more of a statement of rules for that individual practice for prescribing controlled substances. Things like single pharmacy use. That makes life easier for the doctor should any issues arise or they need to contact your pharmacy. It shouldnt be an inconvenience for the patient. If you need to change call their office with the new pharmacy info. It takes about 30 seconds to change it.Drug testing is something we all have a beef with. Its not just to make sure that youre not taking anything that could affect overall treatment, but its also to make sure youre taking what youre prescribed, and in some cases, catch a metabolizing issue if one exists.In the US we have had a nation wide Rx database for I guess about 10 years. 3 states were holdouts, but I believe they all provide information now. Its not a bad thing, especially if you are in an accident and cant communicate with the Emergency doctors. In your case where youre getting the same type of drug from more than one doctor you can see the increased risk of an overdose, especially if the doctors arent all aware of what your taking from each of them. And theres a lot more than risk of an overdose. Some interactions can kill you with issues like serotonin syndrome. Tramadol and anti depressants can be a very big deal.These contracts also tell you about Rx refill procedures/hours, so with a contract, you shouldnt be caught short on medication, at least not on the doctors end. The pharmacy and insurance are different problems. I may have a sample opioid contract around if youre interested in seeing one, you can find template on line pretty easy. Theyre just the rules of the practice, there's even a little advice in them sometimes, like a police report will not get you a refill if youre ripped off. Keep your meds safe with the same care youd use to store a firearm. Lock boxes and safes are good ideas, even though they only keep honest people honest. If they steal your safe, you will probably have more important things to report being stolen. So its hard to say if its normal in Canada. Its pretty normal south of the border.
