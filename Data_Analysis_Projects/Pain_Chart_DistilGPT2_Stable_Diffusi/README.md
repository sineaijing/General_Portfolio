# AN ALTERNATIVE TO A RESTRICTIVE PAIN CHART 

## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This project is reimagining the pain chart used in many US medical institutions to fill the gap between the patients' feeling of pain and symptomps and their description of it. 

This project was prompted by the studies and experiences that show that people of colour, especially darkskinned 
people, pain and symptomps are likely to not be taken seriously in medical institutions. When I researched for this project, I found that there's tons and tons of guides to how to talk to your doctor in a way 
where you pain will be believed, but I am interested in seeing how people actually describe their pain and what this does to our way of percieving pain and illness. 

This project interrogates how we are expected to talk about our pain versus how we actually talk about it. What does this do to our understanding and percievement of pain, and it is possible to create a better, more relatable pain chart. 

## Scraping the data 

In order to get real life descriptions of peoples pain I have scraped from a variety of subreddits revolving pain and 
treatments, some of them are specifically of backpain or kneepain, some of them are for people living with migraines 
or chronic pain in any form. The dataset used for finetuning is a dataset created for Assignment 1 of the course AI for Media. It was generated by 
webscraping with Reddit's API praw. All information in the dataset is completely anouymous and impossible to trace back to individuals. 

## DISTILGPT2 & STABLE DIFFUSION 

The scraped statements were used to finetune a finetuned distilgpt2  model from here: https://huggingface.co/distilgpt2
The finetuned model generated prompts used to generate images by the stable diffusion model. Demo model from: https://github.com/kjsman/stable-diffusion-pytorch
