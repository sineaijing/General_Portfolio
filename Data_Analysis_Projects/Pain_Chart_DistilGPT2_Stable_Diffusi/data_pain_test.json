Period.  I have personally helped hundreds of people out of pain, often permanently in minutes to a few hours of gentle \u201creleases\u201d.  The entire program is FREE at www.rrrtv.net  DO NOT purchase the book, it is a free download as well.  Most of the releases involve 3 steps except the hands and feet which have only two steps.  The first step is to slowly and gently position the body part (shortening the target muscle) passively; a friend moves your body part while you relax and do not resist.  Tell your friend if it causes any pain, STOP immediately and move back to where it is painless (you cannot cause and resolve pain simultaneously). Step two (NOT needed in feet and hands) is have a friend hold you in that posture while you gently fire the opposite muscle against resistance.  This is called isometric contraction.  This is not a competition, only apply a very small force.  The purpose here is to induce antagonistic inhibition.  When you contract your biceps you inhibit your triceps so you don\u2019t fight yourself.  Third step is your friend applies a very very light force on a \u201crelaxation point\u201d and very gently attempt to move the skin in ONE DIRECTION.  Do NOT change directions on this relaxation point for the entire session of releases.  KEEP the very light uni-directional force until you feel your fingers begin to slide.  If you observe closely, your skin and your friend\u2019s do not move in relationship to each other\u2026.your skin releases it\u2019s adhesion to the underlying tissues.  Repeat as needed.  Note the increase in range of motion and how the pain falls off in the first 15 minutes and over the next 48 hours.  There are releases for every part of the body.
