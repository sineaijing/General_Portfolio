# Analysis of Spotify personalisation algorithms 

## Project Description 
The project was inspired by the recent event, Eurovision, where contestant competing with a song in their native language instead of English would not rank very high. 
I am interested in understanding if this is a pattern elsewhere. This projects seeks to interrogate how and if the language used in a song influenced how the song will be recommended on the platform, Spotify.

## Technical details 
The project uses the Spotify API to authenticate and access the data for two user accounts registrered for the project. The library, langdetect is installed and used to be able to investigate the 
languages of the songs. Data analysis done with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy and MatPlotLib.
