## Noticing Empty Spaces: Exploring queer potentials within the latent space of VAE's 

### Project Description

This project was part of my final project at the MSc Computing and Creative Industry at the Creative Computing Institute, University of the Arts London. 

Through the ‘making’ and visualization of a latent space, the project aims to uncover queer potentials within the space looking both at the architecture of 
the AI model and the data it’s trained on. More specifically, I explore the latent space in generative Variational Autoencoder by looking into the empty spaces between the data points. 

### Tech Specifications 

The VAE is trained on 2113 images of sea slugs from this library: https://www.gbif.org/dataset/2ef5b736-6664-49. 
The VAE was built with PyTorch, and the latent space visualisation was built with
